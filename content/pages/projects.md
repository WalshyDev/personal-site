## In Development
### Firework
Firework is a very lightweight web framework for Java. Natively supports real ip headers, rate-limiting, middleware and more.

I've used Java to create REST APIs for a long time in and out of work, sadly no framework has fit my needs.
I would like to not be creating a ton of util methods, wrapper classes, etc.

This framework is being created so I (and hopefully others) can have a much better (and quicker!) experience creating REST APIs using Java.
Built in Rate Limiting, Response Caching, middleware, reverse proxy support and a lot more! It's pretty hot ðŸ”¥

This bot was created in September 2016 and was eventually discontinued in April 2018.

FlareBot grew to almost 50,000 servers which in 2018 made it one of the biggest bots on the platform! (These days, that's nothing, it's blown up a lot)
