# WalshyDev

Hello, I am Walshy. I am a full-stack developer who mainly focuses on backend. I love to work on optimisations and analytics.
I maintain many dashboards on my personal [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) instance. This ranges from metrics on my projects, stats for my servers, UK COVID Vaccine stats, etc.

I am constantly working on many projects big or small and have a lot of notes. I decided I will try to categorise things a little more here.
Also, I wanted to write blogs but I like simple quick sites so, I am hosting them here using my own [site generator]().
